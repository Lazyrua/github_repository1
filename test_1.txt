    Q: Cannot push with words----failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Lazyrua/github_repository1.git'
    A: Utilize the strong command: git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories 
      to merge unrelated branchesï¼Œ 
      maybe it will come with a edit window(vim), u can just exit(esc + ZZ) or operate with the hints it gives to u.
      
      Then you can push again~
